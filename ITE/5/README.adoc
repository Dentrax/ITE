[[abstract]]
== Abstract

This link:https://github.com/in-toto/ITE[in-toto enhancement (ITE)] proposes
removing the in-toto signature scheme requirements, and allow users to adopt the signature wrapper that better fits their ecosystem. This has the following general benefits:

1. avoid mandating an ad-hoc signing specification for in-toto
2. Allow for implementers to propose different signing specifications.

In adition, this ITE makes a recommendation using the
link:http://github.com/secure-systems-lab/signing-spec[SSL Signing Spec]. Which
has the following benefits over the current state:

1. Avoids canonicalization for security reasons (i.e., to not parse untrusted input) 
2. Reduce the possibility of misinterpretation of the payload. The serialized payload is encoded as a string and verified by the recipient before de-serializing.
3. This specification also provides a backwards compatible serialization format.

[[specification]]
== Specification

The specification adopted will be the SSL signing spec, as linked above. As
such, we defer to that document to describe the specifics of signature
generation and verification.

[[motivation]]
== Motivation

The early motivations for in-toto to use the current wrapper were to allow for
our sister project, TUF, to transparently use the same crypto provider. The
reasoning back then is that we would maximize code reuse, and allow for users
of both solutions to easily integrate them.

However, as time has shown, keeping these two separately-specified signature
wrappers (i.e., one for TUF and one for in-toto) is rather difficult. As time
passes, and due to the interactions in each community, the signature wrappers
evolve to better fit their user-bases. Adopting a common source of truth (i.e.,
a separate signature specification) should help increase cohesion between
projects while maintaining the original goal of code-reuse and transparent
integration.

In addition, keeping the signature wrapper specification *outside* of the
current in-toto specification will also simplify the specification, which can
now only focus in describing in-toto specifics, rather than cryptographic
building blocks.

[[reasoning]]
== Reasoning

Our goal was to adopt a signature wrapper that is as simple and foolproof as
possible. Alternatives such as [JWS] are extremely complex and error-prone,
while others such as [PASETO] are overly specific. (Both are also
JSON-specific.) We believe the SSL signing spec strikes the right balance of
simplicity, usefulness, and security. 

Further, the SSL signing spec is a "natural evolution" of the current signature
wrapper, which was both defined in the TUF and in-toto specifications. As such,
it allows for a transparent upgrade via their cryptographic provider,
link:https://github.com/secure-systems-lab/securesystemslib[securesystemslib].

Finally, since this is an improved version of the current TUF and in-toto
wrappers, the design allows for a backwards compatible JSON representation,
which would allow for providers/verifiers to continue using metadata with the
old signature wrapper. This way, an upgrade path for existing implementations
exists without ad-hoc measures.

Further information on the reasoning behind the wrapper's specifics is provided in the link:https://github.com/secure-systems-lab/signing-spec#reasoning[signing specification] repository

[[Security]]
== Security

At first sight this proposal is central to security, yet the actual
contribution is to allow for a signature provider to be disaggregated from the
specification. As such, no supply-chain security properties are removed from
the system through this ITE.

The specifics on the signature wrapper provide, at worst, the same security
properties through its backwards compatible json representation. At best, the
changes improve the security stance of implementations since it is not parsing
untrusted input anymore.

[[infrastructure-requirements]]
== Infrastructure Requirements

Since this is a change in the metadata format, no infrastructure requirements
exist.


[[prototype-implementation]]
== Prototype Implementation

See link:https://github.com/secure-systems-lab/signing-spec/blob/master/reference_implementation.ipynb[reference_implementation.ipynb] for an implementation.

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Test Vector
An example of the signature wrapper, to be used as a test vector, follows:

BODY:

```none
hello world
```

PAYLOAD_TYPE:

```none
http://example.com/HelloWorld
```

PAE:

```none
02 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 1d 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
68 74 74 70 3a 2f 2f 65 78 61 6d 70 6c 65 2e 63
6f 6d 2f 48 65 6c 6c 6f 57 6f 72 6c 64 0b 00 00
00 00 00 00 00 68 65 6c 6c 6f 20 77 6f 72 6c 64
```

Cryptographic keys:

```none
Algorithm: ECDSA over NIST P-256 and SHA-256, with deterministic-rfc6979
Signature: raw concatenation of r and s (Cryptodome binary encoding)
X: 46950820868899156662930047687818585632848591499744589407958293238635476079160
Y: 5640078356564379163099075877009565129882514886557779369047442380624545832820
d: 97358161215184420915383655311931858321456579547487070936769975997791359926199
```

Signed wrapper:

```json
{"payload": "aGVsbG8gd29ybGQ=",
 "payloadType": "http://example.com/HelloWorld",
 "signatures": [{"sig": "y7BK8Mm8Mr4gxk4+G9X3BD1iBc/vVVuJuV4ubmsEK4m/8MhQOOS26ejx+weIjyAx8VjYoZRPpoXSNjHEzdE7nQ=="}]}
```

=== Test Suite 
In addition the changes on the test-suite may include loading/generating backwards-compatible metadata.
