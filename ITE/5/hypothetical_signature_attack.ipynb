Thus, there is only one way for the verifier to interpret the bitstream that the signer signed.\n","\n","However, there are ongoing discussions about (1) generalizing the signature wrapper so that it is no longer in-toto/TUF-specific, and (2) supporting in-toto payloads other than JSON. If either of these happen, then it will no longer be feasible to require the payload to be JSON. Instead, the signature wrapper **must** include some authenticated \"context\" indicator that describes how to interpret the payload.\n","\n","If the signature scheme does *not* include an authenticated context indicator, then an attacker can take a legitimate signed message of type X and get the victim to verify and interpret it as type Y.\n","\n","What follows is a worked example showing how it can happen in a realistic scenario.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"jKjOIpaez5J-"},"source":["## Scenario"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"X4CrxasPz5_R"},"source":["This proof-of-concept assumes the following.\n","\n","(1) In-toto has been extended to support three different encodings of the link format: JSON, [CBOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBOR), and [Protobuf](https://github.com/grafeas/grafeas/blob/63aff549c1813170558b49e40f41147fd31ad1e3/proto/v1beta1/intoto.proto). In this scenario, the cryptographic wrapper has three fields:\n","\n","* `payload`: The serialized JSON, CBOR, or Protobuf byte stream.\n","* `payloadType`: How to interpret `payload`. One of \"JSON\", \"CBOR\", or \"Protobuf\".\n","* `signatures`: Cryptographic signatures over `payload` but **not** `payloadType`. **This is the problem.**\n","\n","Note: In this demo, the wrapper is always JSON, both `payload` and `signatures.sig` are encoded in base64, and the signature is over the raw bits prior to base64 encoding. However, this is immaterial to the attack.\n","\n","(2) There exists a trusted CI/CD service that allows callers to perform arbitrary build requests and returns a signed in-toto link file. This mirrors how system such as GitHub Actions or [Debian rebuilders](https://wiki.debian.org/ReproducibleBuilds) work. In our scenario, the build interface takes three user-defined parameters:\n","\n","*  `command`: The shell command to run.\n","*  `encoding`: The `payloadType` to return.\n","\n","**Problem:** An attacker can trick the CI/CD system to sign arbitrary messages. \n","\n","Suppose the following is a **legitimate** link file:\n","\n","```json\n","{\n","  \"command\": \"echo 'hello world'\",\n","  \"products\": { \"stdout\": { \"sha256\": \"a948904f2f0f479b8f8197694b30184b0d2ed1c1cd2a1ec0fb85d299a192a447\" } },\n","  \"materials\": {},\n","  \"_type\": \"link\"\n","}\n","```\n","\n","An attacker can instead get the CI/CD system to **falsely** sign:\n","\n","```json\n","{\n","  \"command\": \"echo 'hello world'\",\n","  \"products\": { \"stdout\": { \"sha256\": \"badbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadbadb\" } },\n","  \"materials\": {},\n","  \"_type\": \"link\"\n","}\n","```\n","\n","This can then be used by the attacker to get malicious file with sha256 hash \"badbad...\" to be accepted by an in-toto verifier."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"CIF11AmzXJuQ"},"source":["## Outline of attack\n","\n","1.
