[[abstract]]
== Abstract

An in-toto Enhancement (ITE) is a design document that describes a new feature
or aspect of the in-toto framework, a setup of its supply chain or an,
organizational aspect of the in-toto project.  This ITE describes the structure
of ITE documents and details the process by which ITEs are created, submitted,
reviewed, finalized, and maintained.

[[specification]]
== Specification

=== What is an ITE?

ITE stands for in-toto Enhancement. An ITE is a design document that describes
a new feature or aspect of the in-toto framework, the in-toto supply chain, or
the process within in-toto project. An ITE provides a concise technical
specification of the feature, describes the motivation for the change, and
discusses the rationale behind the design.

ITEs are the primary mechanism for proposing major new features, for collecting
community input on an issue, and for documenting the design decisions that have
gone into in-toto. Each ITE must have at least one <<Sponsor>>. The ITE Sponsor
is responsible for the ITE overall - building consensus for that ITE within the
community, documenting dissenting opinions, coordinating contributors work, and
generally ensuring the ITE meets the style, format, and quality guidelines
described below. An ITE may also have any number of <<Contributor,
Contributors>> who help write, implement, discuss, or offer feedback about
the ITE. One contributor might do only one or any combination of these things
during any part of the life of a ITE.

Because the ITEs are maintained as text files in a versioned
repository, their revision history is the historical record of the
feature proposal footnoteref:[repo, https://github.com/in-toto/ITE].

[NOTE]
====
For non-text files added to the repository, such as images, the files must be
readable with free or open source tools, and should ideally be editable by
other contributors. For example, use SVG rather than PSD for vector graphics.
====

=== ITE Types

There are three kinds of ITE:

. A **Standards Track** ITE describes a new feature or implementation
 for the in-toto specification. It may also describe an interoperability or
 backwards-compatibility standard which will be supported for the feature in
 current versions of in-toto, moving forward.
. An **Informational** ITE describes an in-totodesign issue, or
 provides general guidelines or information to the in-toto community,
 but does not propose a new feature. Informational ITEs do not
 necessarily represent a in-toto community consensus or
 recommendation, so users and implementers are free to ignore
 Informational ITEs or follow their advice. An example of an informational ITE 
 would be the recommendations for integrating in-toto and TUF.
. A **Process** ITE describes a process surrounding the in-toto proejct, or
 proposes a change to (or an event in) a process. Process ITEs are like
 Standards Track ITEs but apply to areas other than the in-toto specification
 itself. They may propose an implementation, but not for what would be
 generally considered the in-toto codebase; they often require community
 consensus; unlike Informational ITEs, they are more than recommendations, and
 users are typically not free to ignore them. Examples include procedures,
 guidelines, changes to the decision-making process, and changes to the tools
 or environment used in in-toto development. Any meta-ITE (ITE focusing on the
 improvement of the in-toto Enhancement process) is also considered a
 Process ITE.

=== ITE Terminology

==== Editor

The ITE editors are individuals responsible for managing the administrative
and editorial aspects of the ITE workflow (e.g. assigning ITE numbers and
changing their status). See <<editor-responsibilities, ITE Editor Responsibilities & Workflow>> for
details. 

ITE editorship is by invitation of the current editors. All of the ITE workflow
can be conducted via the GitHub ITE Repository footnoteref:[repo] and pull
requests. Editors are members of a GitHub group called `ITE-editors`.

==== Contributor

A ITE may have any number of `Contributors` who help write, implement, discuss,
or offer feedback about that ITE. One contributor might do only one or any
combination of these of these things during any part of the life of a ITE.
While we invite contributions by companies or other organizations, contributors
listed in a ITE need to be specific people.

==== Sponsor

Each ITE has at least one "Sponsor".

The ITE Sponsor is a contributor who is responsible for the ITE throughout its
lifecycle. Their responsibilities include:

* Building consensus for that ITE within the community
* Documenting dissenting opinions
* Coordinating contributors' work
* Ensuring the ITE meets the style, format, and quality guidelines
* Maintaining the ITE after it is finalized
* Setting and communicating the schedule as needed

The Sponsor of a ITE may or may not do any of the tasks other contributors do.
For example, one sponsor might write large portions of one ITE, while another
sponsor might leave the writing to other contributors.

Anyone may be Sponsor for a ITE, though it should be someone familiar enough
with in-toto, the in-toto project, and the ITE workflow to effectively guide
the ITE to completion.

A ITE may have more than one Sponsor, especially after it has been finalized
and is being maintained over time. For simplicity, this document uses the
singular ("The ITE Sponsor", "a sponsor") when referring the one or more people
in the role of "Sponsor" of a ITE.

Sponsors have committer/write access on the ITE repository, but should
only approve and merge pull requests for ITEs to which they are assigned.

==== Reviewer

The ITE Reviewer is the contributor who will make the final decision whether to
accept a ITE. In all cases where this document refers to the `Reviewer`, it
means "an editor who will review this ITE."

[[requirement-levels]]
==== Must/Should/May

ITE documents _must_ follow link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119[RFC 2119]
which defines key words to "indicate requirement levels". These are listed
below:

. **MUST** This word, or the terms "REQUIRED" or "SHALL", mean that the
   definition is an absolute requirement of the specification.
. **MUST NOT** This phrase, or the phrase "SHALL NOT", mean that the
   definition is an absolute prohibition of the specification.
. **SHOULD** This word, or the adjective "RECOMMENDED", mean that there
   may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances to ignore a
   particular item, but the full implications must be understood and
   carefully weighed before choosing a different course.
. **SHOULD NOT** This phrase, or the phrase "NOT RECOMMENDED" mean that
   there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances when the
   particular behavior is acceptable or even useful, but the full
   implications should be understood and the case carefully weighed
   before implementing any behavior described with this label.
. **MAY** This word, or the adjective "OPTIONAL", mean that an item is
   truly optional.

NOTE: When choosing to go counter to SHOULD or SHOULD NOT guidance,
the reasons behind that choice SHOULD be documented.

=== ITE Workflow

==== Overview

Before delving into the details of the ITE workflow, let's take a high-level
look at how ITE might go.

. **<<start, Initial Discussion>>** - Andrea has an idea for new feature and emails it in-toto-dev@googlegroups.com.
  She discusses the idea with the group, determining that the idea is worth pursuing.
  She chooses to be the "<<Sponsor>>" for this potential ITE.
  She <<discussion, gathers initial feedback>> from the community, adjusts her design as needed,
  records the reasons for design choices, and keeps track of differing views.
  Kelly, an expert in the area for this ITE, volunteers to be the <<Editor>> for this ITE.

. **<<submission, Submission>>** - Andrea writes up the proposal using the ITE
  document template as a guide.
  She includes supporting documentation
  and a minimal prototype implementation sufficient to convey the viability of the design.
  She submits the ITE to the <<editor, ITE editors>> for
  <<approval, approval as a Draft ITE>>.
  One of the editors checks the submission and determines it is ready to considered as a ITE.
  They "approve" the submission, assigning the ITE a number,
  and the submission becomes a "<<draft, Draft>>" ITE.

. **<<draft, Draft Status>>** - While the ITE is a "<<draft, Draft>>", Andrea continues to gather
  feedback, change the proposal, and record the reasoning and differing views.
  At the same time, she and other contributors continue expanding and refining
  the prototype implementation as needed to match the current state of the ITE.
  When Andrea believes the ITE is stable, addresses all major design and scope
  questions, and represents the consensus of the community, she then asks the
  <<Reviewer>>, in this case the <<Editor>> Kelly, to review the ITE for
  Acceptance.

. **<<review, Review>>** - Kelly reviews the ITE and any related discussions
  and implementation. Kelly agrees with Andrea that consensus has been reached
  regarding the ITE and that the implementation is far enough along to enusure
  that the design is stable and complete. Kelly marks the ITE as an "<<accepted,
  Accepted>>" ITE.

. **<<accepted, Accepted Status>>** - Andrea and other contributors
  complete all remaining implementation related to the
  "<<accepted, Accepted>>" ITE (code, documentation, or other changes). The
  specification is updated and a reference to this ITE is added.

. **<<final, Final Status>>** - When the implementation is complete
  and all changes have been published or otherwise incorporated into the
  appropriate code repositories, the ITE status is changed to "<<final, Final>>"
  (or in some cases "<<active, Active>>"). The ITE is done.

. **<<maintenance, Maintenance>>** - At some later date, the ITE may need to be
  updated with minor changes and clarifications.  As <<Sponsor>> of the ITE,
  Andrea makes changes as needed or hands off sponsorship to someone else.
  Updates follow the same basic ITE workflow.  For extensive changes or
  additions, Andrea will start a whole new ITE instead of updating the original
  ITE.  This new ITE might expand on the orginal or might <<replaced, replace>>
it.

. **<<Other ITE Outcomes, Other Outcomes>>** - Not all ITEs will be accepted and finalized.
  Other possible outcomes include "<<rejected, Rejected>>",
  "<<deferred, Deferred>>", "<<withdrawn, Withdrawn>>".

IMPORTANT: The above is only a high-level overview of the ITE workflow.
The full and complete description of the ITE workflow is provided below.
Read the full description below before starting a ITE.

[[start]]
==== Start with an idea for in-toto

The ITE process begins with a new idea for in-toto.
A single ITE should contain a single key proposal or new idea.
The more focused the ITE, the more successful it tends to be.
The ITE editors reserve the right to reject potential ITEs
if they appear too unfocused or too broad.
If in doubt, sponsors should split their ITE into several well-focused ones.

[NOTE]
====
Enhancements or patches which have a smaller impact often don’t need an ITE.
These can be handled via the regular in-tot development workflow with a GitHub 
issue and/or pull request to the appropriate repository.

An ITE may still have an accompanying GitHub issue as a placeholder.  This
might be useful, for example, if implementation of the ITE is later found to
have introduced a bug; being able to link the `regression`-labelled GitHub issue
to the placeholder is valuable for tracking purposes. In such a case be sure
to specify a "<<header-issue, issue>>" section.

====

==== Find a Sponsor

Each ITE must have a "<<Sponsor>>" -- someone who writes the ITE using the
style and format described below, shepherds the discussions in the appropriate
forums, and attempts to build community consensus around the idea. The ITE
Sponsor should first attempt to ascertain whether the idea is ITE-able.
Posting to the in-toto-dev@googlegroups.com mailing list or opening an issue in
the specification repository footnoteref:[repo] is
the best way to go about this.

[[discussion]]
==== Discuss the idea with the community

Vetting an idea publicly before going as far as writing a ITE is meant
to save the potential sponsor time. Many ideas have been brought
forward for changing Jenkins that have been rejected for various
reasons. Asking the in-toto community first if an idea is original
helps prevent too much time being spent on something that is
guaranteed to be rejected based on prior discussions (searching the internet
does not always do the trick). It also helps to make sure the idea is
applicable to the entire community and not just the sponsor. Just because an
idea sounds good to the sponsor does not mean it will work for most people in
most areas where in-toto is used.

Once the sponsor has asked the in-toto community whether an idea has any chance
of acceptance, a "pre-Draft" ITE should be presented to as a pull request to
the ITE repository. The sponsor should needs to notify `@in-toto/ITE-editors`
when they are ready to submit the ITE for <<approval, approval as Draft>>.

[[submission]]
==== Creating a ITE Submission

Following a discussion on jenkinsci-dev@googlegroups.com,
the proposal should be turned into as a ITE submission and submitted
via a GitHub pull request to this repository footnoteref:[repo].

IMPORTANT: All submissions must go through pull request,
even those by editors or contributors with "git push" privileges
for the ITE repository footnoteref:[repo].

To submit a ITE for <<approval, approval as Draft>>, the ITE sponsor should:

. Fork the ITE repository footnoteref:[repo].
. Clone their forked repository locally.
. Create a new branch called `ite-submission` in their clone.
. Copy the folder `ITE-template/0000` to `ITE/0000`.
. Modify the template ITE in `ITE/0000`.
. Commit and push the changes to their fork
  and submit a pull request targeting the `ITE/master` branch.
. Add the following line to the description of the PR to indicate that the ITE
  is being submitted for approval as draft:
  "Submitted for approval as draft ITE by `@in-toto/ITE-editors`."
  If this is a PR that was created earlier to gather feedback,
  the line requesting approval should be added as a comment when the ITE is
  ready.

The sponsor may alter the steps above or do something else entirely
as long the result is a PR with a submission in the appropriate format
with a comment asking for approval as draft.

[[approval]]
==== Approval as Draft ITE

A ITE editor will check the submission for conformance with ITE structure and
formatting guidelines.  Editors may make minor changes to make the submission
meet the requirements for approval as a Draft ITE. If a ITE requires major
changes, editors will add specific feedback and send the submission back to the
sponsor for revision.

IMPORTANT: "Approval as Draft" is *not* the same as <<accepted, accepting the ITE>>.
"Approval as Draft" is an initial conformance and viability check.

The ITE editors will not unreasonably deny a ITE "Draft" status.
Reasons for denying ITE "Draft" status include:

* duplication of effort
* being technically unsound
* not providing enough information in all <<Required Sections>>

The <<Reviewer>> for this ITE may be consulted during the approval phase,
and is the final arbiter of a submission's approvability as a Draft ITE.

Once ITE meets requirements for structure and formatting,
the editors will approve the submission as a draft ITE
by following the steps outlined in the
<<approve-as-draft, editors' "Approve as Draft" section>>.
When they are done, the Draft ITE will have an official ITE number and
the submission PR will have been merged to a matching folder
(for example,
`link:https://github.com/in-toto/ITE/tree/master/ITE/1[ITE/1]`)
in the `master` branch.

Editors are not the only ones who can approve a submission.
Non-editor contributors who have "git push" privileges for the
ITE repository footnoteref:[repo] may also approve submissions.
When doing so, that contributor must handle the tasks
that would normally be taken care of by the ITE editors
(see <<editor-responsibilities, ITE Editor Responsibilities & Workflow>>).
This includes ensuring the initial version meets the expected standards
for a Draft ITE.

[[draft]]
==== Refining a Draft ITE

The version of a ITE that is approved as a Draft ITE
is rarely the same as the final version that is reviewed and hopefully accepted.
A Draft ITE often requires further refinement and expansion
before it is sufficiently complete and represents the consensus of the community.

Standards Track ITEs consist of two parts, a design document
and a prototype implementation.
The prototype implementation should be co-developed with the ITE,
as ideas that sound good in principle sometimes turn out to be impractical
when subjected to the test of implementation.

A ITE's sponsor is responsible for collecting community feedback on a ITE
before submitting it for review.
Potential changes to a draft ITE may be discussed further on in-toto-dev@googlegroups.com.
The ITE sponsor may also ask ITE editors for further feedback regarding the

As updates are necessary, the ITE sponsor and other contributors
should push commits to their fork of the ITE repository footnoteref:[repo],
and submit pull requests targeting the `master` branch.

[[review]]
==== ITE Review

Once the sponsor believes a ITE meets at least the minimum criteria to be "<<Accepted, Accepted>>",
they request the ITE be reviewed for acceptance, usually via
an email to the in-toto-dev@googlegroups.com mailing list.
The ITE <<Reviewer>> and their chosen consultants then review the ITE.
If the Reviewer agrees that ITE is ready, they mark the ITE as "<<Accepted, Accepted>>".
If they do not agree, they leave the ITE as a "Draft", awaiting further revision.
In either case, the reviewer must send a detailed response
to the in-toto-dev@googlegroups.com mailing list explaining their decision.

ITE review and resolution may also occur on a list other than in-toto-dev@googlegroups.com.
In this case, the "Discussions-To" header in the ITE will identify the
appropriate alternative list where discussion, review and pronouncement on the
ITE will occur.

[[accepted]]
==== Accepting a ITE

For a ITE to be "Accepted" it must meet certain minimum criteria.
It must:

* provide a net improvement.
* represent the consensus of the community, including documentation of
  dissenting opions.
* clearly define the scope and features of the proposed enhancement.
* describe a completed design that addesses any major design questions.

For ITEs that include implementation based on the proposal,
the implementation must meet certain minimum criteria.
It must:

* be solid and have progressed enough to resolve major design or scope questions.
* not complicate in-toto unduly.
* have the same license as the component the
  proposal is meant to be added to (or Apache 2 licensed by default).

By marking an ITE as "Accepted" the Reviewer indicates they believe that the
ITE has clear scope, design completeness, community consensus, and (if
applicable) in-progress implementation.  Without all of these a ITE cannot be
accepted.  For this reason, it is not unusual for ITEs to remain in "Draft"
state even after they have strong community support and progressing
implementation.  They must still pass the other criteria, such as scoping and
design completeness.

Once a ITE has been accepted, the implementation must continue to progress
and eventually be completed.

Ideally, all changes to a ITE should be completed before it is "Accepted",
but surprises may still occur.  Changes might be minor changes,
such as clarifications or typo fixes, or major changes,
which would alter the intent, scope, API, or core behavior of the ITE.

All changes to an already "Accepted" ITE, must be submitted via PR as usual.
In the case of major changes,
the Sponsor should also communicate those changes on the mailing list
and take sufficient time to ensure there is consensus on the changes before merging them.
A link to any discussion should be added to the PR for the change
and to the <<Required Sections, References>> section.
If there are significant objections or questions around proposed changes,
the ITE Sponsor or Reviewer may choose to return the ITE to a "Draft" status
for more extensive discussion and eventual <<review, review again for acceptance>>.

[[final]]
==== Finalizing an ITE
When the implementation is complete and incorporated into the
appropriate "main" code repository, the ITE sponsor will change
the ITE's status changed to "Final".

Active:: [[active]]
Some Informational and Process ITEs may have a status of "Active" instead of "Final"
These ITEs are ongoing and never meant to be completed per se. E.g. ITE 1 (this ITE).

[[maintenance]]
==== ITE Maintenance

Even after a ITE reaches "Final" status, it may need to be updated.

In general, Standards track ITEs are not modified after they have
reached the Final state. Once a Standards ITE has been completed, Jenkins developer
documentation must become the formal documentation of the expected behavior.

Informational and Process ITEs may be updated over time to reflect changes
to development practices and other details. The precise process followed in
these cases will depend on the nature and purpose of the ITE being updated.

Replaced:: [[replaced]]
Final ITEs may eventually also be "Replaced" - superseded by a different ITE -
rendering the original obsolete.
This is intended for Informational ITEs, where version 2 of an API can replace version 1.
When a ITE is marked as replaced, the <<header-superseded-by, Superseded-by>> header
must be filled in with a link to the new ITE.

==== Other ITE Outcomes

Not all ITEs will be accepted and finalized.

Rejected:: [[rejected]]
A ITE <<Reviewer>> may choose to reject a ITE.
Perhaps after all is said and done it was not a good idea
or perhaps a competing proposal is a better alternative.
It is still important to have a record of this fact.
+
Rejecting a ITE is a very strong statement.
If the reviewer believes the ITE might eventually be accepted with sufficient modification,
the reviewer will not reject the ITE.
If a reviewer is confident ITE will never be accepted,
they should inform the ITE sponsor as soon as possible to prevent wasted effort.
On the other hand, even an <<accepted, Accepted>> ITE may ultimately be rejected
at some point before it reaches "<<final, Final>>" status,
due to factors not known at the time it was Accepted.
+
Upon the request of the sponsor, the reviewer may choose to return a
Rejected ITE to Draft status, but this is at the discretion of the reviewer.

Withdrawn:: [[withdrawn]]
A ITE <<Sponsor>> may choose to withdraw a ITE.
Similar to "Rejected", "Withdrawn" means that the ITE sponsor
themselves has decided that the ITE is actually a bad idea,
or agrees that a competing proposal is a better alternative.

Deferred:: [[deferred]]
A ITE can also be assigned a status of "Deferred". The ITE sponsor or an
editor can assign the ITE this status when no progress is being made
on the ITE. Once a ITE is deferred, a ITE editor can re-assign it
to draft status.

==== Updating ITE Status and Resolution

Whenever a ITE status changes, the "Status" field in the ITE document must be
updated.

The possible paths of a ITE's status are as shown in Figure 1:

.ITE Workflow
image::workflow.png[ITE Workflow]

When a ITE is Accepted, Rejected or Withdrawn,
a "<<header-resolution, Resolution>>" section must be added to the ITE Header
with a link to the relevant post in the in-toto-dev@googlegroups.com mailing list archives or the GitHub issue tracker.

==== Resolving Disputes

Except for decisions by a ITE's <<Reviewer>>,
the ITE process is run by
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making[consensus].
It is the responsibility of every contributor to respect other contributors,
listen to their perspectives, and attempt to find solutions that work for everyone.

If consensus cannot be achieved on a ITE,
contributors may request that the <<reviewer, ITE Reviewer>> intervene.
The reviewer will consider the matter, and render their decision,
including describing what actions will be taken and documenting their reasoning.

=== ITE Guidelines

==== Required Sections

All ITEs MUST have the following parts to be "approved as Draft":

. **Metadata** - table containing the <<metadata, ITE Header Preamble>> about the ITE,
  including the ITE number, a short descriptive title, the names,
  and optionally the contact info for each sponsor, etc.
. **Abstract** - short (200 word) description of the technical issue
  being addressed.
. **Specification** - The technical specification should describe the
  syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be
  sufficiently detailed to allow new or existing Jenkins developers to
  reasonably understand the scope/impact of an implementation.
. **Motivation** - A clear description of the motivation is critical for any ITE
  that wants to change Jenkins or the Jenkins project.
  The motivation section should clearly explain why the existing
  code base or process is inadequate to address the problem that the ITE solves.
  A ITE submission without sufficient discussion of its motivation
  will not be approved as a ITE Draft.
. **Reasoning** - The reasoning describes why particular design decisions were
  made.  It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related
  work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other systems.
+
The reasoning section provides evidence of consensus within the
community and describes important objections or concerns raised
during discussion.

. **Backwards Compatibility** - All ITEs must include a section describing
  any incompatibilities and their severity.
  The ITE must explain how it proposes to deal with these incompatibilities.
  If there are no backwards compatibility concerns, the section must say that.
. **Security** - All ITEs must include a section describing their security impact.
  This includes outlining what was done to identify and evaluate security issues,
  discussion of potential security issues and how they are mitigated or prevented,
  and how the ITE interacts with existing permissions, authentication, authorization, etc.
  If the ITE has no impact on security, the section must say that.
. **Infrastructure Requirements** -
  All ITEs must include a section describing their impact on
  the in-toto project infrastructure and its supply chain,
  including additions or changes, interactions with exiting components,
  potential instabilities, service-level agreements,
  and assigning responsibility for continuing maintenance.
  Each ITE must explain the scope of infrastructure changes with sufficient detail
  to allow initial and on-going cost (in both time and money) to be estimated.
  If the ITE has no impact on infrastructure, the section must say that.
. **Testing** -
  All ITEs which include code changes must include a section summarizing how the
  changes will be tested. The ITE itself need not include a complete test
  plan—this could be developed concurrently with the rest of the
  implementation—but it should set out expectations for testability. If the ITE
  has no testing needs, the section must say that.
. **Prototype Implementation** --
  If a ITE will include code changes,
  this section will provide links to a an open source prototype implementation of those changes.
  The prototype implementation must be present for a ITE to be approved as <<draft>>.
  The prototype implementation must be sufficient to convey the viability of the design
  for a ITE to be <<accepted>>.
  While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the
  specification and reasoning before writing code,
  the principle of "rough consensus and running code" is still useful
  when it comes to resolving many discussions of API details.
  ITEs which will not include code changes may omit this section.
. **References** -- When moving a ITE from a Draft to "Accepted" or "Final" state,
  the references section must be updated to include links to the pull requests
  and mailing list discussions which were involved in the process. The ITE
  should self-document the process in which it was developed.

WARNING: ITE submissions that do not adequately complete any of the above
sections will not be approved as ITE Drafts.

The final implementation must include test code and documentation
appropriate for either the Jenkins user or developer documentation.

==== ITE File Format

ITEs are UTF-8 encoded text files using the
link:https://asciidoctor.org[AsciiDoc] format.
AsciiDoc allows for rich markup that is still quite easy to read,
but can also be used to render good-looking and functional HTML.

[[metadata]]
==== ITE Header Preamble

===== Required Metadata

All ITEs MUST begin with an AsciiDoc table containing metadata relevant to the
ITE:

[source,asciidoc]
----
.Metadata

. **ITE** -- ITE number, given by the ITE editors. Use `0000` until one is assigned.
. **Title** -- Brief title explaining the proposal in fewer than 50 characters
. **Sponsor** -- <<Sponsor>> of the ITE, in essence, the individual
  responsible for seeing the ITE through the process.
. **Status** -- Draft :speech_balloon:, Deferred :hourglass:, Accepted :ok_hand:,
  Rejected :no_entry:, Withdrawn :hand:, Final :lock:, Replaced :dagger:, Active :smile:.
. **Type** -- Describes the type of ITE: Standards, Informational, Process
. **Created** -- Date (`%Y-%m-%d`) when the document was first created.

=====  Additional Header Rows

Issue:: [[header-issue]]
An **issue identifier** row is available to specify a linked placeholder for an
issue in github, if any.

Discussions-To:: [[header-discussions-to]]
For a ITE where final pronouncement will be made on a list other than
in-toto-dev@googlegroups.com or the github issue tracker, a **Discussions-To**
row will indicate the mailing list or URL where the pronouncement will occur. A
temporary Discussions-To header may also be used when a draft ITE is being
discussed prior to submission for pronouncement.

Requires:: [[header-requires]]
ITEs may have a **Requires** row, indicating the ITE numbers that this
ITE depends on.

Superseded-By:: [[header-superseded-by]]
ITEs may also have a **Superseded-By** row indicating that a ITE has been
rendered obsolete by a later document; the value is the number of the ITE that
replaces the current document. The newer ITE must have a **Replaces** row
containing the number of the ITE that it rendered obsolete.

Resolution:: [[header-resolution]]
A **Resolution** section will be added to ITEs when their status is set to
Accepted, Rejected or Withdrawn.
It will include a link to the relevant post in the
jenkinsci-dev@googlegroups.com mailing list archives.


==== Auxiliary Files

ITEs may include auxiliary files such as diagrams. Such files must be
named appropriately, with lowercase letters and no spaces, and be included in
the directory with the `README.adoc` describing the ITE.

=== Reporting ITE Bugs, or Submitting ITE Updates

The process for reporting a bug or submitting a ITE update depends on several factors,
such as the maturity of the ITE, the preferences of the ITE sponsor, and the nature
of the comments. For the early draft stages of the ITE, it's probably best to
send  comments and changes directly to the ITE sponsor. For more mature, or
finished ITEs consider submitting corrections to the ITE repository
footnoteref:[repo] or the in-toto issue tracker
footnoteref:[issues, https://github.com/in-toto/ITE/issues].  If the ITE sponsor is an
in-toto developer, assign the bug/patch to them, otherwise assign it to an ITE
editor.

When in doubt about where to send changes, please check first with the ITE
sponsor and/or a ITE editor.


Even ITE sponsors with git push privileges for the ITE repository should submit
via Pull Request, with the exception of status or resolution updates
which may be pushed directly given the change was already discussed
and agreed to elsewhere.

[[transferring]]
=== Transferring ITE Sponsorship

It occasionally becomes necessary to transfer sponsorship of ITEs to a
new sponsor. In general, it is preferable to retain the original sponsor as
a co-sponsor of the transferred ITE, but that's really up to the
original sponsor. A good reason to transfer sponsorship is because the
original sponsor no longer has the time or interest in updating it or
following through with the ITE process, or has fallen off the face of
the 'net (i.e. is unreachable or not responding to email). A bad
reason to transfer sponsorship is because the sponsor doesn't agree with the
direction of the ITE. One aim of the ITE process is to try to build
consensus around a ITE, but if that's not possible, a sponsor can always
submit a competing ITE.

Ownership of a ITE may also be assumed via pull request.
Fork the ITE repository, footnoteref:[repo] make the sponsorship
modification, and submit a pull request. At the same time, send a message asking
to take over, addressed to both the original sponsor and the ITE editors via
in-toto-dev@googlegroups.com. If the original sponsor doesn't respond to email in a timely
manner, the ITE editors will make a unilateral decision (it's not like such
decisions can't be reversed :)).

[[editor-responsibilities]]
=== ITE Editor Responsibilities & Workflow

A ITE editor must subscribe to the in-toto-dev@googlegroups.com list and must
watch the ITE repository footnoteref:[repo]. Most correspondence regarding ITE
administration can be handled through GitHub issues and pull requests.

Aside from the editorial cases outlined below, editors should submit all
changes as GitHub pull requests (the same as any other contributor).

==== Conformance check

For each new ITE submission, an editor will:

* Read the ITE to check if it is ready, sound, and complete. The ideas
 must make technical sense, even if they don't seem likely to be
 accepted.

* The title should accurately describe the content.

* Edit the ITE for minor non-controversial language
(spelling, grammar, sentence structure, etc.), markup, code style changes.
For significant or time consuming changes,
the editor may choose to provide feedback instead.

==== Request Changes

If the ITE isn't ready, an editor will send it back to the sponsor for
revision with specific instructions.

==== Approve as Draft

Once the ITE is ready for the repository, a ITE editor will:

. Assign a ITE number (almost always just the next available number, but
  may also be a special/joke number, like 666 or 3141).
. Update the folder number to match the ITE number
. Update the ITE number in the document.
. Update the ITE status using the to draft.
. Commit all changes and push them to the branch in the PR
. "Squash and merge" the PR into the `master` branch.

==== Permission group membership

Editors add and remove Sponsors from the appropriate permission groups on the
ITE repository. When a ITE includes a new Sponsor, an editor will add that
person to the "ITE Sponsors" or GitHub group respectively. When someone is no
longer an active Sponsor, a ITE editor will remove them from the permission
group.  Editors will clean up the the permission groups from time to time as
they see the need or are asked to do so.

== Motivation

in-toto has classically been driven by "you-had-to-be-there" development. With
specific changes largely being driven by smaller independent groups of
developers (sometimes just one). Sometimes, decisions were made and not
properly documented, which resulted in additional overhead and mind-reading
efforts to dig long-established rationales.

Design documents extending back into the history of in-toto are few and far
between, as the project grew organically over time. As such, a contributor,
existing or future, must read mountains of code, pull requests, mailing list
discussions, etc, in order to fully understand how/what/why for many major
subsystems, design decisions and already-explored-paths within the in-toto
framework.

The in-toto Enhancement aims to address both of these major issues by
providing an understood process for making sizable, but understandable,
enhancements to in-toto.

=== Benefits to existing developers

ITE provides a systematic approach for vetting and developing new proposals and
ideas for in-toto. By encouraging "everybody to follow the rules" it will be
easier for existing developers to get their ideas and changes into in-toto 
without finding themselves mired in unspoken cultural norms within the project.

=== Benefits to future developers

By providing clear, understandable, and bite-sized design documents which would
explain various subsections of in-toto. ITEs also make it clearer how an
ambitious new developer to the in-toto project can propose, and make progress
upon, a new idea they have for in-toto.

Overall, less chaos and more productivity is the rationale for ITE. 

== Reasoning

=== Based on Python PEP, TAPS and JEP

The process ITE is modeled after the python, TUF and Jenkins communities, who
have successfully navigated several large-scale reworkings of their codebases,
specifications and processes over the past decade. This includes most notably
the multi-year project of Python 3 (formerly Python 3000) and key format
changes after security audits, as it is in the case of TUF.

Their Python Enhancement Proposals are largely consensus driven, which is
_mostly_ how work is done presently in the in-toto project, making the PEP
model relatively straightforward to graft onto our existing, processes for
making proposals and deciding upon changes.

The TUF Augmentation Proposal model is a closer relative to ITE's due that
in-toto and TUF are sister projects. Given the closeness of the communities and
their overlapping developer base, trying to maintain similarities with both
processes is paramount.

Finally, the Jenkins Enhancement Proposals were the main inspiration of this
document, as JEP 01 was preceived as clearer, more thorough and less ambiguous
than their Python and TUF counterparts.

=== Differences from Jenkins's JEP

The Jenkin's JEP proposes a BDFL figure as the ultimate source conflict
resolution. Due to the horizontal nature of in-toto, this aspect of JEP 01 was
ommited.

=== Differences from Python PEP

The Python process uses "Rationale" as the heading for the section for
describing design decisions.  However the meaning of "Rationale" is similar to
"Motivation" in some contexts.  We decided to use "Reasoning" instead to avoid
confusion.

=== Differences from TUF's TAPs

The TAP document is closer to a PEP than ITEs are, for ITE's adopted the
organizational structure of JEPs. Furthermore, ITE's adopted asciidoc rather
than markdown, as its syntax has less derivate dialects (e.g., github flavored)
than markdown does. Furtermore, the repository structure of JEP was adopted, as
it allows for the addition of self-hosted diagrams and supporting documents.

=== Asciidoc style and linter

There are a number of possible asciidoc style guidelines.
For example, there are a number of reasons to use
link:http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-recommended-practices/#one-sentence-per-line[one sentence per line],
one phrase per line, or other specific formatting.
However, choosing which guideline to require, recommend, or even make optional,
is a potentially long and difficult process.
Instead of bogging down this ITE in that process,
we decided to consider asciidoc style and formatting guidelines in a later ITE.

== Backwards Compatibility

There are no backwards compatibility concerns related to this proposal.

== Security

There are no security risks related to this proposal.

== Infrastructure Requirements

There are no new infrastructure requirements related to this proposal.
